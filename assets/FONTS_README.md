# Pill Gothic Font Setup

To complete the brand font setup, please add the following Pill Gothic font files to this folder:

## Required Font Files

Add these files to the `/assets` folder:

### Bold (700 weight)
- `PillGothic-Bold.woff2`
- `PillGothic-Bold.woff`
- `PillGothic-Bold.ttf`

### Regular (400 weight)
- `PillGothic-Regular.woff2`
- `PillGothic-Regular.woff`
- `PillGothic-Regular.ttf`

### Light (300 weight)
- `PillGothic-Light.woff2`
- `PillGothic-Light.woff`
- `PillGothic-Light.ttf`

## Where to Get the Fonts

1. Check your brand assets folder for the Pill Gothic font files
2. If you have TTF files, you can convert them to WOFF/WOFF2 using online converters like:
   - https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2
   - https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff

## Note

The CSS is already configured in `/css/main.css` to use these fonts. Once you add the files here, the website will automatically use Pill Gothic as the brand font throughout the site.

If you don't have all three weights, you can modify the font-face declarations in `/css/main.css` to only include the weights you have available.
